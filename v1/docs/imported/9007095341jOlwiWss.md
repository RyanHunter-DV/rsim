# release version 1.x



# Commands supported for nodes

# component

format: `component 'vlnv' do-en`

Define a component that can be used for build HDL design and corresponding verify components.

## generator

format: `generator 'name' do-end`

To specify a generator to build this component, the name of the generator must be defined at global, which means the generator name specified here is the reference of the pre-defined generator.

The do-end block has parameter settings for this generator

## generator::parameter

format: `parameter :set, {id=>value}`

To set one/more parameters which pre-defined by the generator chain, all ids that specified here shall be pre-defined at top generator.

## busInterface

format: `busInterface 'vlnv'`

A command to specify the vlnv which to reference a pre-defined interface.

## ~~channel~~

  

~~format:~~ ~~`channel 'vlnv', :as=>'name'`~~

~~Command to describe interconnections within this component,~~

## ~~subComponent~~

~~Command to specify a nested component. subComponent can build instance of an HDL component. That means by using of this command, all HDL modules can be generated through following materials:~~

*   ~~busInterface command, specified in current component~~
*   ~~VLNV, given by defining current component~~
*   ~~Custom logics by given \*.vsrc according to the fileSet.~~
*   ~~subComponent, give the information for instance:~~
    *   ~~verilog parameter specification, this will be an option for generator while building this component to HDL.~~
    *   ~~interface connection,~~

  

## model

## model::port

Command for single port description, for ports only connected with others. In \*.vsrc file will describe internal wires/ports for RTL, which has similar format as the model::port, but not exists in \*.rh files, which is not part of the IP-XACT standard yet.

#TBD, detailed format need to be determined.

## model::bus

format: `bus 'vlnv', :as=>'instName', :view=>[:onMaster|:onSlave]`

Specifying a bus with vlnv which previously defined in busDefinition. By declaring this which can be used in \*.vsrc by directly reference the instance name.

## model::view

## model::view::fileSet

## Extended commands for building an HDL model

The commands are not of IP-XACT standard but can be used to build a design HDL by using the similar command type file that specified by `fileSet` in node.rh, those kind of files are only for RTL building and with .vsrc as extension.

#TBD, more design specific commands, I need a more complicated project to figure out the final decision.

# Rsim-v1 Features and strategies

# Major tool flows

The major tool flow will be:

1. ENV check
2. load plugins
3. load nodes ➝ elaborate
4. build if has
5. compile if has
6. run if has

  

## ENV check

*   RSIM\_ROOT\_NODES, all root node files given by bootenv, separate by the colon, like: `./root.rh;./import/ip/root.rh`
*   STEM, the absolute path of current working area. Shall be set before calling this tool.

## Plugin loading flow

The Rsim tool will support loading plugins, the plugins for generating only, call like a generator chain.

Insert the file through 'rhload' command.

Declare a new generator plugin through 'generator' command and set the 'root' to it.

Shall support plugins:

*   build flow
*   simulator flow
*   run test flow

All plugins will be defined through the generator command, and with a code block, within the block, there will be many commands for defining the behavior of generators.

**_Commands supported in generator definition block:_**

*   root, the specification of this generator is the root of the generator chain, this will be registered to the callable stack in Rsim tool.
*   selector, chose next subsequent running generator
    *   generator name or object of generator instance must be specified
    *   ':phase', specify the running phase of the selected generator,[](https://app.clickup.com/9007095341/v/dc/8cduqhd-667/8cduqhd-2398?block=block-9ea34dcf-5a75-4d18-ae26-1da1e8885de1)
    *   ':target', for component generators, a target component shall be specified.
*   exe, specifying the tool executor
*   parameter, to add the parameters supported by this generator or set a parameter with a certain value.

### build flow loading

Use generator chain mechanism to build the source files into data base, and finally generate the target files used by config settings.

### simulator flow loading

TBD

### runtest flow loading

TBD

### Running phases

This chapter depicts the phase concept in generator running.

Phase is a running stage of every generator, while defining a chain, a selector will be used to

In one generator's selector, the phase will be specified by users as an integer value, so as the next generator selector, however, in overall, the phase of each different generator will be placed as a float typed value, like:

```elixir
generator 'a' do
  selector 'b',:phase=>0
  selector 'c',:phase=>1
end
generator 'b' do
  selector 'ba',:phase=>0
  selector 'bb',:phase=>1
end
generator 'bb' do
  selector 'bbb', :phase=>2
  selector 'bba', :phase=>0
end
# finally, the phase of 'ba' is 0.0; phase of 'bb' is 0.1, phase of 'bbb' is 0.12
```

If a phase option is not specified in selection, then the tool will be treated to run at the last phase.

Generators in one chain node will have no dependencies, that means the selector command also indicates that the next selected generator will depends on current generator been executed..

  

  

  

## Node files loading flow

Use ENV variable to load all root files like: `$RSIM_ROOT_NODE = ./root.rh;./import/tree/root.rh` , node contents will be loaded firstly like:

1. first root in RSIM\_ROOT\_NODE
2. sub nodes included by root above
3. next root in RSIM\_ROOT\_NODE
4. sub nodes included by above root
5. ... recursively

All nodes are placed as global commands that represents the seven top level IP-XACT concepts.

Loading the node files will firstly build the top level structures, such as configs, design, components, interface definition and tests etc. Those structure can be registered first at the MetaData module.

After all nodes are loaded, the next step is to elaborate those definitions. Which will start calling recursive commands within those top scopes. Since the config object will call to set, or override default options, it will be elaborated at the last position. The elaborate order:

1. interface definitions
2. components
3. tests
4. design
5. config

After elaborating, the components or interfaces that are not used by current config will be removed from the internal database.

  

  

# Error handling

This chapter depicts how to report with different possible errors.

## User node errors

This can be various unexpected errors, so the tool will display error information of which node file is now loading, and the error stack, how which line of the node file reports the error.

## Errors can be predicted

Those kind of errors may be like illegal user node specifying items, to solve that, the tool will raise certain errors defined by the tool and the top Rsim run API will collect and report those kinds of errors.

# Dispatch and cmd executing flow

- [ ]     ~~strategy 1: Plan to use the ruby's eventmachine mechanism to run generators as a separated flow with the main server, which contains the IP-XACT meta data.~~
- [ ]     strategy 2: Use typical multiple thread controller to dispatch commands. Using the Thread object to control multiple threads.

  

  

  

  

  

  

Support IP-XACT

Declare a design for a project.

Design is the top container of a project, it will be a centralized placeholder for all instances under this project.

  

Support for nested components.

Support for leaf components.

Describe running tests.

  

  

*   Separate step executing
    
    `-e 'build(:Config)'` , run build flow.
    
    `-e 'compile(:Config)'` , run compile flow from build ➝ compile.
    
    `-e 'compile(:Config,:skip)'` , run compile flow directly, skip the build flow.
    
    `-e 'run(:Test)'` , run test from build ➝ compile ➝ run.
    
    `-e 'run(:Test,:skip=>{:build,:compile})'` , run test flow directly, skip compile and build flow.
    
    `-e 'run(:Test,:skip=>{:build})'` , run test from compile ➝ run, skip build.

Fully support IP-XACT features, Private ([https://app.clickup.com/9007095341/docs/8cduqhd-667/8cduqhd-207](https://app.clickup.com/9007095341/docs/8cduqhd-667/8cduqhd-207))

Shall support full meta-data components and a vendor component that coded by Verilog modules.

## Separate step executing

Users can specify with -j option to directly start from the certain step. The tool has following major steps for users:

*   build ➝ build flow, to generate all necessary target files and EDA command files for a specified config.
*   compile ➝ compile flow, if no -j specified, then the tool will execute from build ➝ compile, else will directly call the generated compile command to do EDA compilation and elaboration.
*   run ➝ run test flow, similar as compile, to call EDA to run simulation.

  

* * *

  

Some of examples will be firstly located in the git project source: [https://github.com/RyanHunter-DV/rsim](https://github.com/RyanHunter-DV/rsim)

  

# Major flow for generator

![](https://t9007095341.p.clickup-attachments.com/t9007095341/40da47be-b6bb-46e6-adb6-3de05b852cca/image.png)

1. reading root and its corresponding nodes, file based on root.rh and node.rh
2. Assemble different concepts such as interface, design, config, and component etc.
3. Elaborating the loaded nodes, and building required database within tool.
4. Setup generator chains and build done in out dir.
5. Call generator chains to build target files, the data information will come from the rsim tool by SOAP protocol.

# Support Generator chain

The generator chain are used for external tools or scripts actions such as typically the build flow, compile flow and run test flow.

Since the typical flows are very common for different project, the generator chain will be described in the common flow libs, different projects only have to customize it with different configurations. For specific projects, which may require a special generator chain, then users can added it in project's flow directory.

the generator shall be easy plugin.

*   Chain can be declared by the generator command.
*   Can specify other generator chain or component generator by selector command.
*   Using separate phases, by a non-negative float number, the smaller number the phase been executed firstly.

  

# Generator chain calling flow

This chapter depicts how to call built-in generators to build, compile and run tests.

For build flow, a designConfiguration may have different options for the common build generator and component generators, so while calling build.

Major flow for common generator chain:

1. User or the main tool to call generator, like: 'build(:Config)', which will actually call the generator's run API,
2. In run API, first to call the build generator's setup API
3. Load top generator chain, if has executor, then read the options and build the cmd file.
4. If has selectors, then build subsequent generator cmd one by one, and for generator chain, will search the options from config, for component generator, search corresponding options in component DB.
5. After building all cmd files, then to call the cmd files one by one according to the phase features. If two phases has no dependency, then the main tool can dispatch the cmds in parallel.

  

# Build flow chain

This generator chain used to publish target standard files such as verilog HDL or systemverilog verification files.

Major flow:

1. User call 'build(:Config)', the top generator has no exe
2. Assemble each component's builder, if user specified, then use the specified builder, else use a default.
    1. This will be determined while user declare a new component. So in generator view, all component will have a generator.
3. call build.setup, to generate all cmd files of each component
4. call the cmd files.

  

# Formats & Commands

## generator

Command in top rh file declares a generator chain, format is `generator <vlnv>,<block>`

*   vlnv is the unique name of the generator chain.
*   block is the definition of this generator chain.
    *   [selector](https://app.clickup.com/9007095341/v/dc/8cduqhd-667/8cduqhd-1162?block=block-f46ddffc-fc56-462e-bf03-784bf9d9867c)
    *   [group](https://app.clickup.com/9007095341/v/dc/8cduqhd-667/8cduqhd-1162?block=block-ba3ade63-0bf5-431e-be67-50f66b34fb7e)
    *   phase, specify the executing stage by an float number.

  

## selector

Choosing one or more generator chains, while calling this chain, all selected are required as well.

format is `selector <group>,<refname>,<type>`

## group

Specify the group name this generator chain belongs to, format: `group <name>`

## phase

TBD.

  

# Loading generator chain

This chapter depicts how to load a built-in generator plugin.

A new generator chain can be defined by the generator command and a code block to define the detailed behaviors with commands in the Generator class. By using the generator command a new object will be instantiated in the top level of the rsim tool (declared as the Rsim module, which is the top namespace for all IP-XACT data).

generator is a global command that users can call it to create a new generator plugin.

# Sketches

How to use a complaint generator chain to generate DE and DV target files?

*   hidden, for standalone call or chain invocation.
*   phase, for calling sequence.

  

> take rcg as an example, ResetGen component has many source files to be generated by rcg, but the parameter can only support a filelist, then how to arrange the separate files into one filelist and generate through rcg?

  

- [x]     require knowledge of SOAP?

  

- [ ]     How to, or any scenario that requires communication through SOAP between generator and DE? Following are two strategies to solve the communication between generator and DE.
    - [ ]     instead of building a common ruby lib, The tools can be call like: rsim is always running while a generator will be called simultaneously with a parallel thread, then if generator requires information, they can send a request through SOAP to get information from rsim main.
    - [ ]     buildflow to build SOAP compliant APIs into out dir, which can be directly called by all compliant generators, for example, in rcg, which can call `getFileName` to get a specific file from the DE, by which can be used to generate the DE related fileSets. By using of this, the rcg generator shall compliant with the IP-XACT as well, better to store the source in a project tree or common lib, and can be generated by the root generator, like: rootGen ➝ build generator chain(rcg) ➝ build target file.
